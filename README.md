# RESOURCES

Though I originally created this markdown file to keep resources at one place for me([on my github repo](https://github.com/saarques/Resources)), but after some time, I thought it would be great to share it with you all here.

Though most of the resources here are from Kaggle itself, I believe finding them under a single hood would be a jackpot. 
I will be making updates to this file regularly, if you have any suggestions or resources to add, please do comment!
